      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve been curious about how things work. I used to disassemble toys and electronic devices just to see what was inside and figure out how they worked. Growing up, I was also drawn to computers because of games like Minecraft, where I hosted servers, built structures, and engineered machinery inside the game. I also played Counter-Strike and various RPGs. At first, it was all about gaming, but over time, I became more interested in how systems ran behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
